Progress - I've successfully downloaded several satellite images that span the area of Missoula County and stitched them together to create one raster image. 
        I've also created an NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegitation Index) layer than can be plotted on top of the baselayer to visualize vegitation health. 
        This code is set up in a way that I can loop a list of dates and download, process, and save the satellite images from each date.
Problems - I'm having some serious issues with the python geopandas package. There appears to be a recent update in the fiona package which geopandas relies on, 
        I've spent a couple of hours trying to problem solve this with the help of chatGPT and StackOverflow, but have had no luck. This package is necessary to 
        handle vector data which I will use to crop images to the shape of Missoula County.
Plans - I have two goals for this nect week. First I want to properly handle the shapefiles I'll be using to plot the vector data for Missoula county. This will 
        require some slight restructuring of my code to crop satellite images to within the bounds of Missoula County. My second goal is to reorganize my main code 
        chunks to be more function oriented. My client has suggested that it would be helpful for my code to be modularized. I intend on wrapping the functionality
        of the main satellite image processing loop into functions that can be reused.
        I haven't been keeping track of my time spent but I would estimate I've spent around 40 hours on this project.

Progress - I completed both goals, using a shapefile to only query data inside of MSO county and I restructured my code to into reuseable functions.
        I also made some improvements such as saving rasters as Cloud Optimized Geotiffs and reprojecting rasters to Web Mercator.
        Lastly I began looking into what tools I will want to use to build my web application.
Problems - No issues to report currently. I just have some learning to do about how to structure a web application.
Plans - My plans for this week are to build the framework for my web application. I'll worry less about the formatting this week and focus on getting the 
        functionality working.
